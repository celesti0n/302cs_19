//This is a new class which stores information about the four players on the board. I have moved some of the methods/variables from WarlordModel
//in here. I think it is a lot better if score/isAI/checkWinner stuff is separated from the physical Warlord, from a design POV.
//e.g. if the warlord instance is removed for some reason (maybe when it dies?) points can't be set anymore for the player. later on when
//we implement
//'ghosts' functionality, players might still get points even when their warlord is destroyed.


//There are four players in a game - player 0, 1, 2 and 3. So create four instances of PlayerModel on the InGameViewController
//Then create four instances of WarlordModel and call the new setPlayer() method to connect it up
