//This class is in charge of the entry point of the application (contains the main method, and the javafx start method). 
//Has all your typical .setScene and .show calls in order to set the Stage, load the scene onto the stage, and load the correct FXML
//onto the scene. Our implementation uses ViewLoader to deal with Loading, so the input here is just the ID assigned from the
// hashmap in ViewLoader.
